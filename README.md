The dashboard is built on a cleaned and transformed dataset (ETL) containing diagnostic test sales, patient demographics, test details, referral sources, and employee performance data from a healthcare diagnostic center (synthetic or anonymized real data). This is a real life data of a diagnostic center, so dataset can not be shared.
